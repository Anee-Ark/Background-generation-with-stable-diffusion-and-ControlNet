# üì∏ Integrated Image Enhancement for eCommerce Product Images

## Overview
This project focuses on enhancing product images for eCommerce platforms by implementing advanced AI-based image processing workflows. It utilizes tools like Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, Pixelcut API, and various Python libraries to achieve professional and visually appealing outputs

## üöÄ Key Features

- Product Isolation: Mask generation for precise product segmentation using rembg.
- Background Integration: Replace distracting backgrounds with clean, consistent, and lifestyle backgrounds using Stable Diffusion and Pixelcut API.
- Shadow Enhancement: Add realistic shadows for depth and natural blending.
- eCommerce Compliance: Ensure technical specifications like resolution, color space, and product focus are met.

## üéØ Challenges Addressed

- Inconsistent Backgrounds:
Original images had unpolished or cluttered backgrounds.
- Lack of Visual Appeal:
Missing shadows and depth made the product look unrealistic.
- Technical Compliance:
Standardized resolution, lighting, and composition for eCommerce platforms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- Python Libraries
  rembg: Background removal and mask creation.
  Pillow (PIL): Image manipulation, shadow generation, and blending.
  Requests: API integration for Pixelcut.
  
- APIs
  Pixelcut API: Fast background generation using text prompts.
  
- Models
  Stable Diffusion v1.5 with ControlNet for background control.
  FineTuned Stable Diffusion (ControlNet): AI-based background generation.

## üîß Implementation Process

- Step 1: Product Isolation
Used rembg to create a binary mask of the product for accurate segmentation.

- Step 2: Background Generation
Leveraged Stable Diffusion with ControlNet for customizable, high-quality backgrounds.
Integrated Pixelcut API for fast cloud-based background generation.

- Step 3: Adding Shadows
Applied Gaussian blur to simulate realistic shadows.
Adjusted opacity and placement to enhance depth.

- Step 4: Blending and Finalization
Combined the masked product with generated backgrounds.
Ensured the output meets eCommerce standards.
Resolution: 2000x2000 pixels.
Product Coverage: 85%+ of the frame.
Format: RGB color space (PNG/JPG).

## üìà Key Outcomes

Enhanced visual appeal with customizable backgrounds and realistic shadows.
Compliance with eCommerce requirements.
High resolution (2000x2000 pixels).
Clean, focused product presentation.
Efficient workflows using AI models and APIs for quick, reproducible results.
